The idea of this file is to use in conjunction with pytesseract to be streamlined to be specifically used for converting a picture of a table to a string. 
There are still a couple of bugs such as some spaces in the image are read as '='s to sign.. so that needs to be fixed. Before providing the pic as an input try 
to make sure that it is cropped to only include the table and nothing else.
Thank You.
